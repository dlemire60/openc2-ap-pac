#### Abstract:
This specification defines an actuator profile to automate
collection of security posture attributes from virtual and
physical computing resources using OpenC2. Security Posture
Attribute Collection (PAC) supports security automation by
providing mechanisms to collect and aggregate the configuration
and status of network components for use in situational
awareness, security posture evaluation, and response actions.
This actuator profile defines the OpenC2 Actions, Targets,
Arguments, and Specifiers along with conformance clauses to
enable the operation of OpenC2 Producers and Consumers in the
context of PAC. It covers identification of computing resources,
definition of security-relevant resource attributes, and
controlling the collection of those attributes using direct pull
or event-based push mechanisms.

Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is an effort to rigorously
standardize command and control of vital cyber defense systems.
OpenC2 is a concise and extensible language to enable the command
and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or
systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products,
technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the
implementation.

# 1 Introduction

*The content in this section is non-normative, except where it is
marked normative.*

**Note:** This Actuator profile is consistent with Version 1.0 of
the OpenC2 Language Specification
[\[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0\]](#openc2-lang-v1.0).

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and
control of cyber defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically
uses a request-response paradigm where a Command is encoded by a
Producer (managing application) and transferred to a Consumer
(managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transfer
protocol, and the Consumer acts on the request and responds with
status and any other requested information.

This specification defines an Actuator profile for **Posture
Attribute Collection (PAC)**. In particular, the specification
comprises a set of Actions, Targets and Target Specifiers,
Command Arguments, and Actuator Specifiers that integrates PAC
functionality with the OpenC2 Command set. Through this Command
set, cyber security orchestrators may gain visibility into and
provide control over PAC in a manner that is independent of the
instance of the PAC function.

All components, devices, and systems that provide PAC
functionality MUST implement the identified OpenC2 Actions,
Targets, Specifiers, and Arguments as specified in the
Conformance section of this specification.

Though cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or
instances may implement multiple Actuator profiles, a particular
OpenC2 Message may reference at most a single Actuator profile.
The scope of this document is limited to PAC.

The rest of the specification is organized as follows:

The remaining of Section 1 includes information about the IPR
policy, terminology used, and document conventions pertinent to
this Actuator profile specification.

[Section 2](#2-section-heading) (normative) binds this particular
profile to Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification
[\[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0\]](#openc2-lang-v1.0). It enumerates the
components of the Language Specification that are meaningful in
the context of PAC and defines components that are applicable to
this distinct profile. In addition, Section 2 defines the
Commands (i.e., the Action/Target pairs, arguments, and
associated specifiers) that are permitted in the context of PAC.

[Section 3](#3-conformance) (normative) presents definitive
criteria for conformance so that cyber security stakeholders can
be assured that their products, instances and/or integrations are
compatible with this profile (OpenC2 Actuator Profile for Posture
Attribute Collection Version 1.0).

[Appendix E](#appendix-e-orchestrator-consumer-operating-model)
(non-normative) describes the operating model for an
"Orchestrator Consumer", an OpenC2 element that can receive
commands from a higher-level ("upstream") Producer and then
command lower-level ("downstream") Consumers to implement those
commands.

[Appendix F](#appendix-f-example-appendix-with-subsections) (non-normative)
provides multiple examples of Commands and associated Responses
(JSON serialization).

## 1.1 Changes from earlier versions

This is the initial version of this specifciation.
<!-- Optional section -->

## 1.2 Glossary

### 1.2.1 Definitions of terms

*This section is normative.*

-   **Action**: The task or activity to be performed (e.g.,
    'deny').

-   **Actuator**: The function performed by the Consumer that
    executes the Command (e.g., 'Posture Attribute Collection').

-   **Argument**: A property of a Command that provides
    additional information on how to perform the Command, such as
    date/time, periodicity, duration, etc.

-   **Command**: A Message defined by an Action-Target pair that
    is sent from a Producer and received by a Consumer.

-   **Consumer**: A managed device / application that receives
    Commands. Note that a single device / application can have
    both Consumer and Producer capabilities.

-   **Message**: A content- and transport-independent set of
    elements conveyed between Consumers and Producers.

-   **Producer**: A manager application that sends Commands.

-   **Response**: A Message from a Consumer to a Producer
    acknowledging a Command or returning the requested resources
    or status to a previously received Command.

-   **Specifier**: A property or field that identifies a Target
    or Actuator to some level of precision.

-   **Target**: The object of the Action, i.e., the Action is
    performed on the Target (e.g., IP Address).

### 1.2.2 Acronyms and abbreviations

TBSL

### 1.2.3 Document conventions

#### 1.2.3.1 Naming Conventions

-   [\[RFC2119\]](#rfc2119)/[\[RFC8174\]](\l) key words are in
    all uppercase.

-   All property names and literals are in lowercase, except when
    referencing canonical names defined in another standard
    (e.g., literal values from an IANA registry).

-   Words in property names are separated with an underscore
    (\_), while words in string enumerations and type names are
    separated with a hyphen (-).

-   The term "hyphen" used here refers to the ASCII hyphen or
    minus character, which in Unicode is "hyphen-minus", U+002D.

#### 1.2.3.2 Font Colors and Style

The following color, font and font style conventions are used in
this document:

-   A fixed width font is used for all type names, property
    names, and literals.

-   Property names are in bold style â **'created\_at'**.

-   All examples in this document are expressed in JSON. They are
    in fixed width font, with straight quotes, black text and a
    light shaded background, and 4-space indentation. JSON
    examples in this document are representations of JSON
    Objects. They should not be interpreted as string literals.
    The ordering of object keys is insignificant. Whitespace
    before or after JSON structural characters in the examples
    are insignificant [\[RFC8259\]](#rfc8259).

-   Parts of the example may be omitted for conciseness and
    clarity.
    > These omitted parts are denoted with ellipses (...).

Example:

```
{
  "action": "deny",
  "target": {
    "file": {
      "hashes": {
        "sha256": "22fe72a34f006ea67d26bb7004e2b6941b5c3953d43ae7ec24d41b1a928a6973"
      }
    }

# 3 Conformance
<!-- Required section -->

(Note: The [OASIS TC
Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#wpComponentsConfClause)
requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee
Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or
OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a
set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation
of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to
the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done
by listing the conformance clauses here. For the definition of
"conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined
Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dConformanceClause).

# Appendix B. Safety, Security and Privacy Considerations

<!-- Optional section -->

(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees
consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy,
and/or data protection in implementations of their specification
and document them for implementers and adopters. For some
purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA
registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification
might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications,
because they involve communications between systems, message
formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit.
For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists âeavesdropping,
replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and
man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks
as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed
in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this
section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters
can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject
to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security
Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more
information.

# Appendix E. Orchestrator Consumer Operating Model

This appendix explains the operating model for an Orchestrator
Consumer (OC). Figure E-1 shows the relevant operating context.

![Figure E-1: Orchestrator Consumers Context](images/Orchestrator-Consumer.drawio.png)

The diagram illustrates the interactions of the OC with the
upstream Producer that commands it and the downstream Consumers
that it commands. Any particular downstream Consumer may support
any mixture of OpenC2 actuator profiles (APs) and other
non-OpenC2-based interfaces for interacting with the OC. Tracking
the available downstream Consumers and their capabilities is a
local matter for the OC.

## E.1. Terminology

-   **Upstream:** refers to interfaces and external entities
    through which the OC receives OpenC2 commands and via which
    it sends responses.
-   **Downstream:** refers to interfaces and external entities
    through which the OC sends commands via OpenC2 and/or other
    mechanisms and via which it receives responses and data.
-   **OpenC2-based Interfaces:** refers to any interface, inbound
    or outbound, where the OC exchanges information via formats
    and protocols defined by OpenC2 specifications (i.e., OpenC2
    Language Specification, Actuator Profiles, and Transfer
    Specifications).
-   **Other mechanisms:** refers to any interface, inbound or
    outbound, where the OC exchanges information using formats
    and protocols not defined by any OpenC2 specification.


## E.2 Assumptions

1.  All commands received via the OCâs upstream interface:

    1.  Are governed by OpenC2 specifications;

    2.  Are defined by an Actuator Profile not used with any of
        the downstream Consumers (in the figure above this is the
        Posture Attribute Collection (PAC) AP);

    3.  Provide enough information for the OC to select a
        mechanism to interact with downstream Consumers;

    4.  Provide enough information for the OC to determine which
        downstream Consumers to command; the number of downstream
        Consumers can range from a single Consumer to very large
        quantities.

2.  Interactions between the OC and its downstream Consumers may
    use any mixture of OpenC2-based and other mechanisms; the
    mechanisms used are opaque to the upstream Producer.

3.  Responses via the upstream interface will typically only
    provide status information regarding the execution of the
    referenced command, but may contain other requested content
    such as a pointer to stored information, or the actual
    information retrieved, based on specifics of the command
    received from upstream.

Assumption 1.ii is a simplifying assumption: when only the OC
supports the AP defining commands received from upstream, there
is no ambiguity regarding what element executes the command. If
both the OC and downstream Consumers support the AP or LS feature
defining the command received from upstream, the OC must
implement suitable decision logic to determine whether to execute
the command locally or trigger downstream commands derived from
the upstream command.

Assumption 3 alters an OpenC2 Language Specification (LS)
default: [*Section
3.3.1.4*](https://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/oc2ls/v1.0/cs02/oc2ls-v1.0-cs02.html#3314-command-arguments)
of the LS states that if the command argument `response\_requested`
is not explicitly specified by a Producer, then the Consumer
should send a complete response. In the case of an OC responding
to an upstream Producer, this default is overridden.

## E.3 Operations

The OC performs the following operations in executing a command
received from the upstream Producer:

1.  Receive command and validate it against the appropriate AP.

2.  Interpret the received command contents to determine:

    1.  The appropriate mechanism (e.g., OpenC2 AP / command,
        other mechanism) to use with downstream Consumers to
        accomplish the intent of the received command. This
        guides the creation of a derived command to send
        downstream;

    2.  What set of downstream Consumers should receive the
        derived command;

    3.  How to process responses from the downstream Consumers;

    4.  What information must be collected to generate a response
        to the upstream Producer.

3.  Generate and send commands (as identified in 2.a) to the
    identified set of downstream Consumers (as identified in
    2.b).

4.  Process received downstream Consumer responses (as determined
    in 2.c) and accumulate information to generate the response
    to the upstream Producer (as determined in 2.d).

5.  When appropriate, generate and send the response to the
    upstream Producer.


## E.4 Notional Example

The OC receives a command for software bill of material (SBOM)
retrievals from the upstream Producer:

1.  Evaluate the command and determine that it is a valid command
    under the PAC AP.

2.  Interpret the command:

    1.  Identify that the command directs SBOM retrieval, so an
        OpenC2 command conforming to the SBOM AP will be sent to
        downstream consumers

    2.  The actuator specifiers in the received command identify
        a set of downstream consumers by a network address block.
        The OC uses its consumer registration information store
        to identify the specific downstream Consumers
        corresponding to the specified network addresses (for
        this example: 10 downstream Consumers).

    3.  The received command directs that retrieved SBOMs be
        stored in a data store.

    4.  The received command indicates a requested response
        containing a success percentage, and a pointer to the
        stored set of SBOMs from the specified downstream
        consumers.

3.  The OC generates and sends commands in accordance with the
    SBOM AP to retrieve SBOMs from the 10 downstream Consumers
    identified in 2.b.

4.  The OC receives responses containing SBOMs from 8 of the 10
    downstream Consumers, and stores those SBOMs in the
    identified data store. The OC receives error responses from
    the other 2 downstream Consumers.

5.  The OC transmits a response to the upstream Producer
    indicating an 80% success rate and providing a pointer to the
    set of 8 SBOMs in the data store.

## 1.3 Some markdown usage examples

**Text.**

Note that text paragraphs in markdown should be separated by a
blank line between them -

Otherwise the separate paragraphs will be joined together when
the HTML is generated. Even if the text appears to be separate
lines in the markdown source.

To avoid having the usual vertical space between paragraphs,  
append two or more space characters (or space-backslash) to the
end of the lines  
which will generate an HTML break tag instead of a new paragraph
tag \
(as demonstrated here).

### 1.3.1 Figures and Captions

FIGURE EXAMPLE: <note caption is best placed ABOVE figure, so a
hyperlink to it will actually display the figure, instead of
rendering the figure off the screen above the caption. The same
placement should be used for table captions>

###### Figure 1 -- Title of Figure
![image-label should be meaningful](images/image_0.png) (this
image is intentionally missing)

###### Figure 2 -- OpenC2 Message Exchange
![message exchange](images/image_1.png)


### 1.3.2 Tables

#### 1.3.2.1 Basic Table
**Table 1-1. Table Label**

| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Item 1 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 2 | Something |
| Item 3 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 4 | text |

#### 1.3.2.2 Table with Three Columns and Some Bold Text
text.

| Title 1 | Title 2 | title 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| something | something | something else that is a long string of text that **might** need to wrap around inside the table box and will just continue until the column divider is reached |
| something | something | something |

#### 1.3.2.3 Table with a caption which can be referenced

###### Table 1-5. See reference label construction

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **content** | Message body as specified by content_type and msg_type. |

Here is a reference to the table caption: Please see [Table 1-5
or other meaningful
label](#table-1-5-see-reference-label-construction) 


### 1.3.3 Lists

Bulleted list:
* bullet item 1.
* **Bold** bullet item 2.
* bullet item 3.
* bullet item 4.

Indented or multi-level bullet list - add two spaces per level
before bullet character (* or -):
* main bullet type
  * Example second bullet
    * See third level
      * fourth level

Numbered list:
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

Left-justified list without bullets or numbers: To list multiple
items without full paragraph breaks between items, add
space-backslash after each item except the last.

### 1.3.4 Reference Label Construction

REFERENCES and ANCHORS
- in markdown source, format the Reference tags as level 6
  headings like: `###### [RFC2119]`
###### [RFC2119]
Bradner, S., "Key words ..."

- reference text has to be on a separate line below the tag

- format cross-references (citations of the references) like:
  `see [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)]`  
"see [[RFC2119](#rfc2119)]"  
(note the outer square brackets in markdown will appear in the
visible HTML text)

- The text in the Reference tag (following ###### ) will become
  an HTML anchor using the following conversion rules:  
  - punctuation marks will be dropped (including "[" )  
  - leading white spaces will be dropped  
  - upper case will be converted to lower  
  - spaces between letters will be converted to a single hyphen

- The same HTML anchor construction rules apply to
  cross-references and to section headings.  
  - Thus, a section heading like "## 1.2 Glossary"  
  - becomes an anchor in HTML like `<a href="#12-glossary">`  
  - referenced in the markdown like: see [Section
    1.2](#12-glossary)  
  - in markdown: `"see [Section 1.2](#12-glossary)"`  
  - similar HTML anchors are also used in constructing the TOC

### 1.3.5 Code Blocks

Text to appear as an indented code block with grey background and
monospace font - use three back-ticks before and after the code
block.

Note the actual backticks will not appear in the HTML format. If
it's necessary to display visible backticks, place a back-slash
before them like: \``` .

```
{   
    "target": {
        "x_kmip_2.0": {
            {"kmip_type": "json"},
            {"operation": "RekeyKeyPair"},
            {"name": "publicWebKey11DEC2017"}
        }
    }
}
```

Text to be highlighted as code can also be surrounded by a single
"backtick" character: `code text`

## 1.4 Page Breaks
Add horizontal rule lines where page breaks are desired in the
PDF - before each major section
- insert the line rules in markdown by inserting 3 or more
  hyphens on a line by themselves:  ---
- place these before each main section in markdown (usually "#" -
  which generates the HTML `<h1>` tag)
